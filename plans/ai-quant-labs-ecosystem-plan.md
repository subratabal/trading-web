# AI Quant Labs Ecosystem - Master Plan

## 🎯 Vision
Create a unified AI platform where different AI-powered domains converge under a single ecosystem, with common authentication, user management, and interactive web applications for each specialized area.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Platform Structure
```

```

## 🔐 Authentication & Access Control

### Single Sign-On (SSO) System
- **Unified Login**: Users can sign in from any domain page
- **PostgreSQL User Table Schema**:
  ```sql
  users {
    id: UUID PRIMARY KEY
    email: VARCHAR UNIQUE
    password_hash: VARCHAR
    profile: JSONB
    access_permissions: JSONB {
      lms: BOOLEAN
      codebot: BOOLEAN  
      trading: BOOLEAN
      finance: BOOLEAN
      data_engineering: BOOLEAN
    }
    subscription_tier: ENUM(free, pro, enterprise)
    created_at: TIMESTAMP
    updated_at: TIMESTAMP
  }
  ```

### Access Control Logic
- User logs in once → Access granted to authorized domains
- Domain pages check user permissions before rendering content
- Subscription-based feature gating within each domain

## 🌐 Domain-Specific Web Applications

### Universal Web App Pattern
Each domain follows a consistent structure:

```
Domain Web App Structure:
├── Frontend Interface (Interactive UI)
├── Backend Agent System
├── Domain-Specific Database
└── API Integration Layer
```

### 1. LMS (Learning Management System)
**Purpose**: AI-powered course creation and learning
**User Journey**:
1. User types: "Create a course on crypto trading"
2. Frontend captures requirements and user outline
3. Backend agents interact with LMS database to:
   - Research existing content
   - Generate course structure
   - Create interactive materials
4. Continuous user interaction for refinement
5. Final course delivered and published

**Key Features**:
- AI Course Generation
- Personalized Learning Paths
- Content Management
- Progress Tracking

### 2. Code Bot (Development Assistant)
**Purpose**: AI-powered coding assistance and automation
**User Journey**:
1. User describes coding task or project
2. Frontend provides project setup interface
3. Backend agents execute in sandboxed environments:
   - Code generation
   - Testing and debugging
   - Code review and optimization
4. Real-time monitoring and steering from frontend
5. Results evaluation and refinement

**Key Features**:
- Agent-based coding
- Terminal integration
- Code review automation
- Project scaffolding

### 3. Trading Intelligence
**Purpose**: AI-powered trading strategy development
**User Journey**:
1. User defines trading strategy requirements
2. Frontend provides strategy configuration
3. Backend agents handle:
   - Market data analysis
   - Strategy backtesting
   - Risk assessment
4. Interactive strategy refinement
5. Strategy deployment and monitoring

### 4. Finance Analytics (Future)
**Purpose**: AI-powered financial analysis and reporting
**Features**:
- Financial modeling
- Risk assessment
- Market analysis
- Investment recommendations

### 5. Data Engineering (Future)
**Purpose**: AI-powered data pipeline creation
**Features**:
- ETL pipeline generation
- Data quality monitoring
- Schema optimization
- Performance tuning

## 🤖 Backend Agent Architecture

### Agent Orchestration System
```
Frontend Request → API Gateway → Agent Orchestrator → Specialized Agents
                                        ↓
                               Domain Database ← → External APIs
```

### Agent Types
1. **Coordinator Agents**: Manage workflow and user interaction
2. **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific expertise (LMS, coding, trading)
3. **Integration Agents**: Handle external APIs and data sources
4. **Quality Agents**: Review, test, and validate outputs

### Agent Communication
- **Event-driven**: Agents communicate via message queues
- **Stateful**: Maintain conversation context and project state
- **Scalable**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Monitored**: Real-time performance and health monitoring

## 🎨 Frontend Design Patterns

### Common UI Components
- **Domain Selector**: Main navigation between authorized areas
- **Project Workspace**: Interactive area for each domain
- **Agent Monitor**: Real-time agent activity visualization
- **Result Viewer**: Output display and evaluation interface
- **Setting Panel**: User preferences and configuration

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Offline functionality where applicable

## 📊 Database Architecture

### Multi-tenant Database Design
```sql
-- Shared Tables
users
organizations  
subscriptions
audit_logs

-- Domain-Specific Tables
lms_courses
lms_progress
codebot_projects
codebot_repositories
trading_strategies
trading_backtests
finance_models
data_pipelines
```

### Data Isolation
- Row-level security based on user permissions
- Domain-specific schemas
- Encrypted sensitive data
- GDPR compliance
